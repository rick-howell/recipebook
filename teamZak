8. 1loaf challah bread (about 1 pound), cut into 1¼-inch slices
9. 4 to 6tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed

11. ½teaspoon ground cinnamon

How to make it great!
Step 1
In a large bowl, whisk together milk, cream, eggs and egg yolks, vanilla, lemon zest (if using), ½ teaspoon cardamom and salt.

Step 2
Arrange challah slices in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Pour custard on top, and let sit at room temperature, uncovered, for 30 minutes, so the bread can absorb the custard, carefully flipping bread slices halfway through.

Step 3
In a medium bowl, whisk together sugar, cinnamon and remaining ¼ teaspoon cardamom. Set aside.

Step 4
Heat a large nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium, then add 2 tablespoons butter and let it melt. Place 2 to 3 pieces soaked challah in skillet, making sure to not crowd the pan. Cook until golden on bottom, 4 to 5 minutes.

Step 5
Sprinkle a little of the cinnamon-sugar mixture on top of each slice, then flip and cook until bottom is glazed and browned, another 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to serving plates, glazed-side up. Repeat with remaining butter, challah and cinnamon sugar. Serve warm, with your choice of toppings.
