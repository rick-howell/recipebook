Ingredients:
  2 ribeye steaks (about 1 inch thick)
  1 lb baby potatoes (halved)
  1 bunch asparagus (trimmed)
  2 tbsp olive oil (divided)
  2 tbsp butter
  3 cloves garlic (minced)
  Salt and pepper (to taste)
  Fresh rosemary or thyme (optional)
  1 lemon (optional)
Instructions:
  Roasted Potatoes:
    Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
    In a bowl, toss halved baby potatoes with 1 tbsp of olive oil, salt, pepper, and a pinch of rosemary or thyme if you like.
    Spread the potatoes on a baking sheet and roast for 25-30 minutes, or until golden and crispy, flipping halfway through.
  Ribeye Steak:
    Season the ribeye steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides. Let them sit at room temperature for 10-15 minutes.
    Heat a skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat and add 1 tbsp of olive oil.
    Sear the steaks for about 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare (adjust time for your desired doneness).
    In the last minute of cooking, add the butter and garlic to the pan. Tilt the pan slightly and spoon the melted butter over the steaks.
    Remove the steaks from the pan, cover with foil, and let them rest for 5 minutes.
  Seared Asparagus:
    While the steak is resting, use the same skillet (with the steak drippings) to sear the asparagus.
    Add the trimmed asparagus to the pan and cook for 3-4 minutes, tossing occasionally, until they are tender and slightly charred. Season with salt and pepper.
    (Optional) Squeeze fresh lemon juice over the asparagus for added flavor.
Serve:
  Plate the ribeye steak with roasted potatoes and seared asparagus. Drizzle any remaining steak butter and garlic over the top of the steak for extra flavor.
