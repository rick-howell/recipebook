Salt and black pepper (to taste)
2) tablespoons olive oil or vegetable oil
2) cloves garlic, minced
1) tablespoon fresh rosemary or thyme (or 1 teaspoon dried)

Prepare the Steaks:

Remove steaks from the refrigerator and let them sit at room temperature for 30-60 minutes.
Pat dry with paper towels.
Season:

Generously season both sides with salt and black pepper.
Heat the Pan:

In a cast-iron skillet or heavy pan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.
Sear the Steaks:

Add the steaks to the pan and sear for 4-5 minutes without moving them.
Flip the steaks and sear the other side for another 4-5 minutes for medium-rare (adjust time for desired doneness).
Add Flavor:

In the last 2 minutes of cooking, add minced garlic, rosemary or thyme, and butter to the pan.
Spoon the melted butter over the steaks as they finish cooking.
